# Wholesale Shops — Workflow

## Primary flow

```
Enquiry → Quotation → Sales Order → Challan / Invoice → Payment/Credit → Warehouse Stock
Purchase: PO → Receive → Stock
```

## Notes

- Tenant isolation applies at every step.
- Product stock movements use the **common inventory engine** when lines are PRODUCT.
- Service-oriented steps (especially Travel) may skip stock deduction.
- Payments/invoices reuse the **common billing engine**.
