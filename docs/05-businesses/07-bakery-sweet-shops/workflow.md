# Bakery / Sweet Shops — Workflow

## Primary flow

```
Walk-in: Product → Billing → Payment → Stock
Custom: Customer → Cake Order → Advance → Production → Delivery → Balance → Invoice
```

## Notes

- Tenant isolation applies at every step.
- Product stock movements use the **common inventory engine** when lines are PRODUCT.
- Service-oriented steps (especially Travel) may skip stock deduction.
- Payments/invoices reuse the **common billing engine**.
